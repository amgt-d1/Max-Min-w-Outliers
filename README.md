## Introduction
* This repository provides implementations of our algorithms for Max-Min Diversification with Outliers.
* As for the details about these algorithms, please read our AAAI2023 paper, [Diversity Maximization in the Presence of Outliers](https://).

## Requirement
* We used a Ubuntu 20 LTS machine and our codes were compiled by g++ 9.4.0.

## How to use
* Compile:
    * g++ -o xx.out main.cpp -O3
    * xx can be arbitrary.
* Run:
    * ./xx.out
* Algorithms:
   * Greedy: our greedy algorithm
   * Stream: our streaming algorithm without coreset
   * Stream-coreset: our streaming algorithm with coreset

## Datasets
* "_dataset" directory has to be located at `src/_dataset` (i.e., src/_dataset/xx.csv, where xx is a dataset name). 
* A dataset has to be a csv file.
   * Each line represents a data item, and, under a d-dimensional vector assumption, each dimension has to be separeted by comma.
     For example, a 3-dimensional dataset has to be:<br>
     ``` 
     1,2,3
     4,5,6
     ``` 
      
   * dimensionality is set in `file_input.hpp`.

## Parameters
* Set some value in the corresponding txt file in `_parameter`.
